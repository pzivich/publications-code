# RE: "Using numerical methods to design simulations: revisiting the balancing intercept"

### Paul N Zivich, Rachael K Ross

-----------------------------------

The folder consists of the R (`balance_intercept.R`), and Python (`balance_intercept.py`) files to replicate the example
shown in Table 1 of the letter.

-----------------------------------

## File Manifesto

`balance_intercept.py`
- Python code to numerically approximate the balancing intercepts.

`balance_intercept.csv`
- R code to numerically approximate the balancing intercepts.
